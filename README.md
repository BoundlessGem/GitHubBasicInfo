Personal understanding of basics and usages of the GitHub
```
GitHub is cloud-based platform 
	• Showcase/share your work
	• Track/manage changes to code overtime
	• Allows separate party review and give suggestions code
	• Collaborate shared projects before integrations. ???

Git is version control system that tracks and changes files
	• Used to give read, write and change privileges on multiple people for group projects
	• Git-based workflow
		○ Create branch of the main copy of the file that owner and collaborators are working on
		○ Allows to edit files on the branch independently and safe from other branches
		○ Git merges your specific changes back to main copy of files to prevent your changes impact on
 		  other people updates(on branches?)
		○ Git keeps track of changes on the project, so all of the collaborators are working on most up
		  to date version of it.

Git/GitHub collaboration
	• When uploaded files to GitHub you are storing them in "Git repository". This means that every
   	  change (or commit) to your files in GitHub. Git will start to track and manage your changes
		○ Commit = recorded change with comment (saved with their own SHA)
			○ SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) identifier is how Git tracks every changes made across the
			  project
	• There are plenty Git-related action which can be done on browser:
		○ Creating repositories, 
		○ creating branches, 
		○ uploading/changing files
	•  However most of the people does their work locally, then continually sync these 
		○ local changes and all Git related data with central "remote" repository in GitHub
			○ These actions can be done straight from IDE with "GitHub Extension" or "GitHub Desktop"
		○ When working as collaborator in group projects in same repository at the same time you will:
			○ Pull: latest changes made by your collaborators from remote repository at the GitHub
			○ Push: back you own changes on this same repository in GitHub
			○ Fetch?
		○ Git will then figure out how to merge this flow of changes and here GitHub will help to manage
		  these changes through features like "pull request"

Repository
	• Folder which contains related items such as files, images, videos, or even other folders 
	• Repository often groups together items which belongs to same project
		○ Often contains "README" file, which contains information of the project 
			□ Often written on Markdown file (.md). GitHub also accept .txt and .rst file types.
		○ When creating new repository, GitHub lets you generate README file at the same time. 
			□ It also offers some other common options such as license file
		
Branch
	• Branching allows to have different versions of the same repository 
		○ By default new repository has one branch named "main" [definitive branch]
		○ Additional branches are made off of the "main" branch in your repository
	• Branching allows to add new features without changing the main source code. The changes/addons of
	  the other branches will not show up to the "main" branch until they are merged. 
		○ You can generate new branches in order to experiment and make edits before
 	      commit them to main through "Merge pull request"
	• New branch is generated by making copy(snapshot) of the "main" branch as it was at saving point
		○ If someone else made changes to the "main" branch while you were working your own branch, you
		  could pull:
			□ "git fetch origin main" 
				□ Downloads latest commits from the "newer" remote "main" branch
				□ Doesn't change your current working files
				□ You see the updates via "git log origin/main""
			□ "git pull origin main while main" 
				□ First fetch then automatically merges those updates directly into your local "main"
				  branch
				□ Updates your local main immediately
				   □ (might cause conflicts if uncommitted changes exist)
				□ Shortcut for "git fetch origin main" + "git merge origin/main"
				
Commit/changes
	• On GitHub making changes and saves are called "commits". Each new commit has its own associated
	  message, which describes of the particular changes they have made. 
	• These commits messages capture the history of each change made, so contributors or collaborators
	  can understand what has changed and why.
	• As soon as the commit is made you can open pull request and start discussion,
	  even before code is finished

Pull request
	• When opened it proposes new changes and requesting that someone review and pull this new
	  contribution and merge it to their branch 
	• Pull request shows "diffs" = differences, of the content from both branches
	• Changes, additions and subtractions are differentiated by colors
	• Reviewing a pull request: when working together with other collaborators or contributors.
	  it's time to discuss and review soon to be added branch
		○ This way others can comment-, propose changes to pull request before merging changes to main
	• About pull request reviews. Alternatively, try the GitHub Skills "Reviewing pull requests"
		From <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world> 
	
Merge pull request
	• After merging the changes within "new branch" will be incorporated into "main" branch
	• Sometimes these "pull" requests encounter conflicts when merging to "main" branch 
		○ GitHub detects that and shows conflict warning, then disables "merge pull request" button
			□ Merge is then prevented until the conflict is resolved 
		○ Conflict warning can be seen on the pull request page by PR author and othe collaborators
			□ Commit can be made to resolve this conflict or discuss at PR comments how to do so

```

```
Pre settings before making or cloning any repositories
	• GitHub  commits by default needs <name> and <email> in order to function
		○ GitHub checks the user by email. Not by username. 
			□ If local email on upload to repository is different from owner it's seen as different
			  contributor
		○ By default these are:
			□ Username: Given name to computer, which could be i.e. "MyName"
			□ Email: Computer device name, which could be i.e. "Desktop - 8SFSD8D"
		○ These can bring some really unfortunate mistakes when coding between PC:s

	• In IDE make a Git profile with your own username, but first let's get hidden email address from
      GitHub
		○ At GitHub, under settings under  => "Emails" 
		○ Select "Keep my email address private"
		○ Under it there is your hidden email address (123456789+name@user.noreply.github.com)
	
	• These two can now be changed from IDE settings or with  Gitbash. (Terminal commands)
		○ IDE: Git => Options/settings => Git Global settings => Set username and Email
		○ Gitbash: (In "Visual studio"  under View tab. There is Terminal) 
			□ git config --global user.name "username"
			□ git config --global user.email "email"
			
		□ If you already failed and read this now. This can rewrite all of the commit history under
		  your name to your "newname" from this local device
		□ --force is POWERFUL command on itself. Only use if: It's your personal project / No one else
		  has clones on your repository yet
			□ git commit --amend --author="username <email>" --no-edit
			□ git push --force
```

```
Get files from GitHub [There are three ways to get copy of GitHub repositories].
	
	• Clone:  When repository is cloned you get full repository to your local computer
		○ All branches (main, any other derived branches)
		○ Every commit ever made on every branch
		○ Complete history of file changes over time
			
	• Download:  In order to save snapshot repository to our local machine
		○ You just want files as they are at that moment of time
		○ Not planning to contribute to the project
		○ Don't need Git or its version control
		
	• Fork: Fork creates copy of another account's repository to your account.
	  Original is called "upstream"
		○ Fork remains linked to original repository. Forked repository is called "downstream"
			□ Allows to submit pull request to original author repository on potential fixes
			□ When original author makes changes on their repository you can sync yours with it
				
Upload files to GitHub []

	• Uploading to repositories applies version control to them
	• Back up your files into the cloud
	• Files are linked to your personal username and can be shared/shown easily to others
	  (privately/publicly)
	
If files are upload through GitHub portal. Be careful, because it will bypass "gitignore" file
we made earlier
	• "gitignore" is made to ignore likes of "bin/", "obj/" and any other build-related files
		○ If its ignored everything will get upload instead and restriction won't work 
			□ At upload it tried to add 26 files instead of three items: one folder,
		      project- and source file.
			
	• Genereal thumb rule is not to push straight to "main branch" instead create new branch
		○ GitHub repository => "main" drop down => "View all branches" => New branch
		○ Git bash (Terminal) Creates and switches to new branch [I recommend this route]
			□ ..\repos\username\repositoryName> 
				□ git checkout -b NewBranchName
					® Currently this is just new "local" derived branch [Not yet at GitHub]
	
	• Open cloned repository In "Visual studio" and under View tab open the Terminal again
		○ Terminal has to be on that cloned repository location ...\repos\username\repositoryName>
		○ Always remember check and choose correct branch before push!
		○ Also copy your additional project to correct Git root before push!!!
			□ git branch
				□ Shows your current branch (Always check the branch!!!)
			□ git checkout -b NewBranchName
				Creates and switches to new branch (If you didn't create new branch earlier)
			□ git checkout BranchName
				□ Switches between branches
			□ git add YourAnotherProjectFolder/
				□ This works only when local clone exist from GitHub through Git [We did earlier]
					® When adding just files  => git add filename.filetype
			□ git commit -m "Add new project"
				□ "Commit" stand for itself and "-m" means "added message" [required by GitHub]
			□ git push --set-upstream origin NewBranchName
				□ Pushes the commit to the current branch on GitHub
				□ --set-upstream Creates link between "local" branch and remote branch[GitHub]
					® i.e. this created local derived branch [git checkout -b NewBranchName]
				□  origin Means your remote branch i.e. GitHub repository 

Once this is done. 
	• Check derived branch on you GitHub repository and merge to the main if there are no problems
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Merge conflict
```
In case of any change is made at remote(GitHub) end, then there is real chance that you might
start making changes on your local "cloned" repository before "pulling" i.e. merging with
the remote changes.
	• This will generate problem where next push won't get accepted, because of the differences
      between local !== remote before trying to push even more to remote repository

		○ Cannot pull, because local has uncommitted changes that conflict
          (Changes which doesn't exist on remote)
			□ Local has to match with remote(before its changes)

		○ Cannot push, because remote has some changes which doesn't exist locally yet
			□ Remote has to match with local(before its changes)

One way is to overwrite local file/files with remote ones. This will be work much like
single pull, but this way we can declare which files will be rewritten and we don't have
to touch on the file which we are working locally.

	• git checkout origin/branchName -- fileName.fileType
		○ Choose from remote the branch and which file to be overwritten
	• git commit -m "Something about restoring this file"
		○ Now we just commit the change we did locally
	• git push
		○ Then lastly we push. This sends that same commit to remote:
			□ "How we restored the file from remote".
			
	• Now the merge conflict from [remote => local clone] is solved and they are in sync
	• We can normally commit new merge from [local clone => remote]

	  Both merges are now finished.

```
