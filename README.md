Personal understanding of basics and usages of the GitHub
```
GitHub is cloud-based platform 
	• Showcase/share your work
	• Track/manage changes to code overtime
	• Allows separate party review and give suggestions code
	• Collaborate shared projects before integrations. ???

Git is version control system that tracks and changes files
	• Used to give read, write and change privileges on multiple people for group projects
	• Git-based workflow
		○ Create branch of the main copy of the file that owner and collaborators are working on
		○ Allows to edit files on the branch independently and safe from other branches
		○ Git merges your specific changes back to main copy of files to prevent your changes impact on other people updates(on branches?)
		○ Git keeps track of changes on the project, so all of the collaborators are working on most up to date version of it.

Git/GitHub collaboration
	• When uploaded files to GitHub you are storing them in "Git repository". This means that every change (or commit) to your files in GitHub. Git will start to track and manage your changes
		○ Commit = recorded change with comment (saved with their own SHA)
			○ SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) identifier is how Git tracks every changes made across the project
	• There are plenty Git-related action which can be done on browser:
		○ Creating repositories, 
		○ creating branches, 
		○ uploading/changing files
	•  However most of the people does their work locally, then continually sync these 
		○ local changes and all Git related data with central "remote" repository in GitHub
			○ These actions can be done straight from IDE with "GitHub Extension" or from "GitHub Desktop"
		○ When working as collaborator in group projects in same repository at the same time you will:
			○ Pull: latest changes made by your collaborators from remote repository at the GitHub
			○ Push: back you own changes on this same repository in GitHub
			○ Fetch?
		○ Git will then figure out how to merge this flow of changes and here GitHub will help to manage these changes through features like "pull request"

Repository
	• Folder which contains related items such as files, images, videos, or even other folders 
	• Repository often groups together items which belongs to same project
		○ Often contains "README" file, which contains information of the project 
			□ Often written on Markdown file (.md). GitHub also accept .txt and .rst file types.
		○ When creating new repository, GitHub lets you generate README file at the same time. 
			□ It also offers some other common options such as license file
		
Branch
	• Branching allows to have different versions of the same repository 
		○ By default new repository has one branch named "main" [definitive branch]
		○ Additional branches are made off of the "main" branch in your repository
	• Branching allows to add new features without changing the main source code. The changes/addons of the other branches will not show up to the "main" branch until they are merged. 
		○ You can generate new branches in order to experiment and make edits before commit them to main through "Merge pull request"
	• New branch is generated by making copy(snapshot) of the "main" branch as it was at that point of time
		○ If someone else made changes to the "main" branch while you were working your own branch, you could pull:
			□ "git fetch origin main" 
				□ Downloads latest commits from the "newer" remote "main" branch
				□ Doesn't change your current working files
				□ You see the updates via "git log origin/main""
			□ "git pull origin main while main" 
				□ First fetch then automatically merges those updates directly into your local "main" branch
				□ Updates your local main immediately (might cause conflicts if uncommitted changes exist)
				□ Shortcut for "git fetch origin main" + "git merge origin/main"
				
Commit/changes
	• On GitHub making changes and saves are called "commits". Each new commit has its own associated message, which describes of the particular changes they have made. 
	• These commits messages capture the history of each change made, so contributors or collaborators can understand what has changed and why.
	• As soon as the commit is made you can open pull request and start discussion, even before code is finished

Pull request
	• When opened it proposes new changes and requesting that someone review and pull this new contribution and merge it to their branch 
	• Pull request shows "diffs" = differences, of the content from both branches
	• Changes, additions and subtractions are differentiated by colors
	• Reviewing a pull request: when working together with other collaborators or contributors. it's time to discuss and review soon to be added branch
		○ This way others can comment-, propose changes to pull request before merging changes to "main"
	• About pull request reviews. Alternatively, try the GitHub Skills "Reviewing pull requests"
		From <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world> 
	
Merge pull request
	• After merging the changes within "new branch" will be incorporated into "main" branch
	• Sometimes these "pull" requests encounter conflicts when merging to "main" branch 
		○ GitHub detects that and shows conflict warning, then disables the "merge pull request" button. 
			□ Merge is then prevented until the conflict is resolved 
		○ Conflict warning can then be seen on the pull request page by PR author and other collaborators
			□ Commit can be made in order to resolve this conflict or discuss at PR comments how to do so

Pre settings before making or cloning any repositories
	• GitHub  commits by default needs <name> and <email> in order to function
		○ GitHub checks the user by email. Not by username. 
			□ If local email on upload to repository is different from owner it's seen as different contributor
		○ By default these are:
			□ Username: Given name to computer, which could be i.e. "MyName"
			□ Email: Computer device name, which could be i.e. "Desktop - 8SFSD8D"
		○ These can bring some really unfortunate mistakes when coding between PC:s

	• In IDE make a Git profile with your own username, but first let's get hidden email address from GitHub
		○ At GitHub, under settings under  => "Emails" 
		○ Select "Keep my email address private"
		○ Under it there is your hidden email address (123456789+name@user.noreply.github.com)
	
	• These two can now be changed from IDE settings or with  Gitbash. (Terminal commands)
		○ IDE: Git => Options/settings => Git Global settings => Set username and Email
		○ Gitbash: (In "Visual studio"  under View tab. There is Terminal) 
			□ git config --global user.name "username"
			□ git config --global user.email "email"
			
		□ If you already failed and read this now. This can rewrite all of the commit history under your name to your "new 			  name" from this local device
		□ --force is POWERFUL command on itself. Only use if: It's your personal project / No one else has clones on your 			  repository yet
			□ git commit --amend --author="username <email>" --no-edit
			□ git push --force
```
